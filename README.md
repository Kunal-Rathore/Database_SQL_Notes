# Database and SQL notes

### This repository contains the notes I created while learning about Databases and SQL. These notes are primarily written using the Obsidian tool and my personal copy, compiled as I progressed through the learning journey.

### The content is based on the DataBase and SQL playlist by CodeHelp YouTube channel, taught by Lakshya Sir.
